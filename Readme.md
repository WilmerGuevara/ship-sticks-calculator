This project was developed using Docker. So all you need is Docker and docker-compose installed.

Once those two features are installed you need to run these commands in the root folder of the project:

1. `docker network create ship_sticks_network` to create the docker virtual network.
2. `docker-compose run api rails db:seed` to populate database with data from provided file `products.json`.
3. `docker-compose run frontend yarn` to create the docker `frontend` container`.

The Frontend will run in http://localhost:3000 and the API in http://localhost:3001.
