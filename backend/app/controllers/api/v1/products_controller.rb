  # Get the product that best fits for the selected dimensions and weight,
  # you can always go bigger, but you canâ€™t go smaller (i.e. if an item is 5"x5"x5", you will need the 6"x5"x6" package,
  # not the 4"x5"x5" package). This is also the case for weight.
  # If params have the exact dimensions and weight of a product then the difference is zero and it returns that product
  # otherwise, it looks for a product with the less useless space and the less useless weight.
  # If there is no product that fits the dimensions and weight, it returns the product with the less useless space and the less useless weight.
  # If there is no product, it returns nil.
  # The useless space is the space that is not used by the product, and the useless weight is the weight that is not used by the product.
  # The useless space and the useless weight are calculated by subtracting the product dimensions and weight to the given dimensions and weight.
  # The less useless space and the less useless weight are calculated by adding the useless space and the useless weight.
  # The product with the less useless space and the less useless weight is the product that best fits for the selected dimensions and weight.
